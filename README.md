# Experiment 223:by alexRuss()

This is a project arbitrarily named "Experiment 223". It's a small portion of experimental development I've been doing, syncing ASCII art to audio, by parsing phoneme data with regular expressions, and reactively streaming them simultaneously. Exposing this portion of it was a bit rushed, but I believe it should display some creative problem solving.  There are some things which I haven't included due to current constraints, that would allow for better syncing. I invite you to run this and give it a spin.  

## Getting Started

To get started, first install all the necessary dependencies.
```
> npm install
```

Run an initial webpack build
```
> webpack
```

Start the development server
```
> npm run start
```

To view your project, go to: [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

## Additional instructions

If I have provided you with an additional mp3 file, navigate to the directory [/src/audio](../master/src/audio) and replace alexruss.mp3 with the provided alexruss.mp3 file.
